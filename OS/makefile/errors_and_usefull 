for formatted errors use sys_err("<what you want>") 
it will automatically append <: No such file or directory> (or whatever it wants)

lseek returns where we are if we use lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_CUR);
 - could be useful if u count backwards till 10th '\n' 
then u lseek and then you go to that place and start printing

when having something like tail exec.c - exec.c -> the '-' means you  have to read from STDIN. 
if you give less than 10 u just use ctrl+D
